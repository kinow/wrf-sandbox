# wrf-sandbox

A sandbox to experiment with the [WRF](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) Open Source weather model.

>The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model[1] /ˈwɔːrf/ is a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. NWP refers to the simulation and prediction of the atmosphere with a computer model, and WRF is a set of software for this. WRF features two dynamical (computational) cores (or solvers), a data assimilation system, and a software architecture allowing for parallel computation and system extensibility. The model serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers. 

My goal is to a) run the WRF model with data provided by a university, or a research centre like NOAA or Nasa, b) understand the moving parts of the model, and c) investigate how workflow and scheduler systems are used with WRF.
